# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.
This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.

We use the following methods for the analysis:

  - Preprocessing the database
  - Reducint the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
  - Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
  - Visualizing classification results 3D and 2D scatter plots
  
## Results

Martha requested us to use unsupervised learning to group cryptocurrencies in a clustering algorithm to create visualizations she can show her board members. We delivered the visualizations as requested in the following ways.

This is an interactive 3D model we created using the PCA algorithm to reduce the cryptocurrencies demensions to three principal components.

This is a 2D scatter plot model we used to show total coines mined vs. total coin supply.

## Summary 
We have identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determined their performance and potential interest for Martha to show the board potential investments in crypto.
